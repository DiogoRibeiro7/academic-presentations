## 🎯 Assessment Philosophy

Our assessment approach is designed to:

1. **Evaluate Multiple Dimensions**
   - Theoretical understanding
   - Practical implementation skills
   - Critical thinking and analysis
   - Communication and presentation

2. **Provide Continuous Feedback**
   - Regular quizzes for knowledge checks
   - Problem sets for hands-on practice
   - Projects for integrated application
   - Self-assessment for metacognition

3. **Align with Learning Objectives**
   - Each assessment maps to specific learning objectives
   - Clear rubrics communicate expectations
   - Multiple assessment types accommodate different learning styles

4. **Promote Mastery Learning**
   - Formative assessments guide learning
   - Summative assessments measure achievement
   - Opportunities for revision and improvement
