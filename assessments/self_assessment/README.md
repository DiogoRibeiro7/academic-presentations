## 🎓 How to Use These Checklists

### Before Starting a Topic

1. **Skim the checklist**
   - Get overview of what you'll learn
   - Identify completely new concepts
   - Set learning expectations

2. **Baseline self-assessment** (optional)
   - Check items you already know
   - See how much you'll learn
   - Identify prior knowledge

### During Study

1. **Periodic checking**
   - After each lecture/reading, review relevant items
   - Check off newly mastered concepts
   - Note items needing more attention

2. **Focused study**
   - Use unchecked items as study guide
   - Prioritize important unchecked items
   - Review materials for gaps

### Before Assessments

1. **Pre-exam check**
   - Go through entire checklist
   - Be honest about understanding
   - Study unchecked items

2. **Confidence building**
   - See how much you've learned
   - Identify remaining gaps
   - Make targeted review plan

### After Assessments

1. **Reflection**
   - Which items correlated with exam?
   - What did you know well?
   - What surprised you?

2. **Follow-up**
   - Review missed items
   - Strengthen weak areas
   - Update checklist accuracy

## ✅ Scoring Your Understanding

For each item, evaluate your understanding:

**Levels of Mastery:**

- **🟢 Proficient:** I can explain this to someone else, apply it in new contexts, and feel confident
- **🟡 Developing:** I understand the basics but need practice or have some gaps
- **🔴 Beginner:** I've heard of this but don't really understand it
- **⚪ Not Covered:** Haven't encountered this yet

**Recommendation:**
- Focus study time on 🔴 and 🟡 items
- Review 🟢 items to maintain understanding
- Ask for help on persistent 🔴 items

## 📊 Tracking Progress

### Method 1: Simple Checkmarks
```markdown
- [x] Item I understand
- [ ] Item I don't understand yet
```

### Method 2: Color-Coded
```markdown
- 🟢 Item I'm proficient in
- 🟡 Item I'm developing
- 🔴 Item I'm a beginner at
```

### Method 3: Dated
```markdown
- [x] [2025-01-15] Learned this on Jan 15
- [ ] Need to learn this
```

### Method 4: Scored
```markdown
- [5/5] Complete mastery
- [3/5] Partial understanding
- [1/5] Minimal understanding
```

## 💡 Study Tips

### When You Have Gaps

**For Conceptual Understanding:**
1. Re-read lecture slides
2. Watch video explanations
3. Read textbook sections
4. Discuss with peers
5. Ask in office hours

**For Mathematical Foundations:**
1. Work through derivations by hand
2. Find alternative explanations
3. Do practice problems
4. Check solutions carefully
